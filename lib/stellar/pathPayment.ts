/**
 * Path payments: settling a debt in an asset the payer does not hold.
 *
 * `pathPaymentStrictReceive` lets the sender spend XLM while the recipient
 * receives an exact USDC amount, atomically, through the Stellar DEX. "Strict
 * receive" is the half that matters for a debt: the *destination* amount is
 * fixed and the source amount floats. The alternative, strict-send, fixes what
 * you spend and lets the recipient receive whatever that buys — which for
 * settling a debt would mean underpaying whenever the book moves, so it is not
 * used here (invariant 1).
 *
 * ## Where naive implementations lose money
 *
 * The path Horizon returns is a *suggestion*, priced against an order book that
 * can move between the quote and the transaction landing. Two failure modes
 * follow, and this module is shaped around both:
 *
 * - `sendMax` set to exactly the quote: any adverse move fails the payment.
 * - `sendMax` set generously: the payer silently overpays into a thin book.
 *
 * The resolution is an explicit, bounded slippage tolerance that the user sees
 * before signing (invariant 3), and a hard freshness window after which a quote
 * must be re-fetched rather than used (invariant 2 — you cannot meaningfully
 * confirm a maximum derived from a stale book).
