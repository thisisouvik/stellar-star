# Architecture Assumptions and Known Limitations

## Architecture Summary

SettleX uses:

- Next.js + TypeScript frontend
- Supabase for app data and realtime sync
- Stellar payment operations for value transfer
- Soroban settlement contract for immutable payment recording
- Separate pool contract for inter-contract withdraw flow

## Key Assumptions

- Users operate on Stellar testnet, not mainnet.
- Wallet extensions (Freighter, xBull, Lobstr) are available client-side.
- Supabase anon key is safe with proper RLS policies.
- Wallet authentication uses a server-generated Stellar challenge, client signature verification, and JWT claims; data access is not based on a client-provided wallet header.
- Contract IDs in env/docs are synchronized with deployed testnet contracts.

## Known Limitations

- Project is testnet-oriented; mainnet operational controls are not included.
- README still needs one explicit phone viewport screenshot for final checklist completeness.
- CI merge protection enforcement is a GitHub repository setting and must be enabled manually in repo settings.
- Wallet UX depends on extension behavior and user approval flow.
- Some screenshots in README are desktop captures; mobile screenshots should be added for evaluator clarity.
- Pool balances are internal contract accounting credits, not native XLM/token custody transfers on-chain.
- `record_payment` stores provided `tx_hash` metadata and relies on app flow integrity; it does not cryptographically verify Horizon payment details inside the contract.

## Operational Constraints

- Any contract redeployment changes contract ID and requires env + README updates.
- Incorrect wallet/account setup can block end-to-end payment tests.
- Supabase configuration errors can affect sync behavior even if chain operations work.

## Recommended Future Improvements

- Add automated e2e tests (Playwright) with mobile viewport assertions.
- Add a script to validate README proof links are live.
- Add an automated checklist CI job that verifies required docs/sections exist.
- Introduce token/native-asset backed pool settlement model (transfer in/out) for stronger economic guarantees.
- Add off-chain verifier service (or on-chain protocol changes) to bind `tx_hash` to payer/member/amount claims.
