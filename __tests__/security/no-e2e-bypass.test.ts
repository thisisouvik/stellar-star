/**
 * Security test: a real (flag-less) production build must NOT contain the E2E
 * wallet bypass. Delegates to scripts/verify-no-e2e-bypass.mjs, which performs a
 * clean production build and greps the emitted bundle for the injected-wallet
 * marker. This is the automated guard for the invariant "no production build
 * contains a code path that bypasses real wallet signing".
 *
 * Why this is opt-in rather than part of the default `npm test`:
 *   It performs a full production build (minutes, not milliseconds), which is
 *   the wrong shape for a unit suite developers run on every change. In CI the
 *   check runs unconditionally as its own job (`security-build-gate` in
 *   .github/workflows/ci.yml), so the gate is always enforced on every PR — it
 *   is simply enforced there instead of here.
 *
 * Run it locally with either:
 *   npm run test:security-build          (the script directly)
 *   RUN_SECURITY_BUILD=1 npm test        (through jest)
